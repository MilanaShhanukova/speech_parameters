    "C50": {
        "description" : "C50 is defined as the ratio of early to late arriving sound energy, where early refers to the sound energy arriving within the first 50 milliseconds after the direct sound, and late refers to the sound energy arriving after this period.",
        "low" : "Low value signifies more reverberation and less clarity, as more sound energy arrives later, contributing to echoes and blurred speech perceptionâ€‹.",
        "high": "High value indicates clearer speech perception, as a larger portion of the sound energy arrives early, contributing to direct and comprehensible speech sounds."
    },
    "STOI": {
        "description": "STOI evaluates the similarity between the clean (reference) speech signal and the processed (possibly noisy or enhanced) speech signal. The metric works on short-time segments of the speech signal. It computes the correlation between the clean and processed signals over overlapping short-time windows, typically 384 milliseconds in length.",
        "low": "0 indicates completely unintelligible speech.",
        "high": "1 indicates perfectly intelligible speech."
    },
    "ESTOI": {
        "description": "eSTOI is designed to handle a wider range of distortion types, including those that are non-linear. eSTOI operates on short-time segments of the speech signal and uses a time-frequency representation. It compares the clean and processed speech signals within these short-time frames. eSTOI typically divides the speech signal into more frequency bands compared to STOI, allowing for a finer granularity in measuring the intelligibility across different parts of the spectrum.",
        "low": "0 indicates completely unintelligible speech.",
        "high": "1 indicates perfectly intelligible speech."
    },
    "PESQ": {
        "description": "Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality is a metric that employs a perceptual model that mimics human auditory perception. It takes into account factors such as time and frequency masking, where the human ear is less sensitive to certain distortions in the presence of louder sounds.",
        "low": "Below 2 indicates poor quality.",
        "high": "Above 2 indicates good quality with the values close to 5 as perfect sound"
    },
    "SNR": {
        "description": "SNR is used to measure the clarity of a signal by comparing the level of the desired signal to the level of background noise. SNR is calculated as the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise",
        "low": "Low value more noise relative to the signal, resulting in poorer quality. An SNR of 0 dB means the signal and noise power are equal, indicating poor quality.",
        "high": "High value indicates a clearer signal with less noise, thus better quality. For example, an SNR of 30 dB means the signal power is 1000 times the noise power, which is a high-quality signal."
    },
    "MOS": {
        "description": "Mean Opinion Score is a subjective metric that quantifies the overall perceived quality of audio or video signals. It is obtained through rigorous testing involving human listeners who rate the quality on a predefined scale, usually from 1 to 5.",
        "low": "Below 3 indicates poor quality.",
        "high": "Above 3 indicates good quality, with values close to 5 indicating excellent quality."
    },
    "Scale-Invariant-Signal-Distortion-Ratio": {
        "description": "Scale-Invariant Signal Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of source separation algorithms. It measures the distortion of the separated signals in a scale-invariant manner, making it robust against variations in signal amplitude.",
        "low": "Low values indicate high distortion and poor separation quality.",
        "high": "High values indicate low distortion and better separation quality."
